#### **Data & code for the "Why do some words have more meanings than others? A true neutral model for the meaning-frequency correlation" paper.**

This repository contains data & code for the "Why do some words have more meanings than others? A true neutral model for the meaning-frequency correlation" paper.

##### **1. Contents**

Thus repository contains the following: 

- *analysis.R* -- the R script used for plotting figures 1 to 3 and running the Spearman correlations. 
* *data* -- folder that contains data generated by the model and the .pkl files used for the heatmap plot. 
- *figures* -- folder that contains figures used in the paper 
- *heatmap.py* -- the Python script that generates Figure 4
- *requirements.txt* -- Python requirements needed to run the model 
- *src* -- folder that contains the *NeutralModel.py* script, which is used to run the model described in the paper 
- *wordnet-ratio.py* -- Python script used to compute the wordnet number of types to total number of meanings ratio

##### **2. Reproducing the analysis**  

The model presented in the paper can be run using Python 3. First, install the required packages from requirements.txt:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, you can run the model like so:

    python3 src/NeutralModel.py --N=100 --S=200 --mu=0.02 --k=0.04 --p=1000 --t=300
    
The parameters can be replaced by arbitrary values, and the results will be saved in the *model-da
